# nemotron_lead - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=9 -->

## Session 0 - Created with team lead

- 创建 team lead `intern_nemotron_lead` 时自动生成本 manage team 常驻任务。
- 本任务在 team 存在期间保持 InProgress。

## Session 1 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Interrupted work recovery coordination

- Audited current team state: workers `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5` were Idle; coordinator and team lead anchor tasks remain Working/InProgress by lifecycle rule.
- Reported first audit to coordinator by peer send; delivery returned `delivered`.
- Mapped stale deleted assignees to current workers:
  - old `intern_nem_dev_1` task231/task228 -> `intern_nemotron_worker_1`, with independent audit by `intern_nemotron_worker_4`.
  - old `intern_nem_dev_3` task217 -> `intern_nemotron_worker_2`, with independent follow-up audit by `intern_nemotron_worker_5`.
  - old `intern_nem_dev_2` task203/task206/task209 coverage question -> `intern_nemotron_worker_3`.
- Created standard current-team task docs for task231 recovery, task217 PM-review recovery, task203/task206/task209 coverage audit, and independent audit tasks.
- Opened coordination PR #313 for the lead-created recovery task docs.
- Kept `nemotron_lead` InProgress and avoided product code changes, implementation tests, merge, and direct main push.

## Session 2 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Worker reports and lead gate decisions

- Received and processed mailbox reports from all assigned workers:
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_1` reported task231 recovery PR #315, docs/status only, with recommendation `blocked/HOLD`.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_4` independently audited task231/task228 evidence and confirmed task228 is bookkeeping only; source branch has no product-code changes and supports the same HOLD result.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_2` reported task217 PM-review recovery PR #316 with recommendation `APPROVE_CLOSE_TASK217`.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_5` independently audited task217 follow-up coverage and confirmed task218 covers the contained causal-conv unblock, while task219 closes the one-iteration train smoke loop.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_3` reported task238 coverage PR #314, classifying task203/task206/task209 as `covered/no recovery`.
- Lead gate decisions:
  - task231/task228 disposition: `blocked/HOLD`; no new implementation task now. Future implementation requires a newer approved launcher package or benchmark-owner equivalence contract for one or more missing M1 targets.
  - task217 disposition: approve close as complete no-launch diagnosis; task218/task219 evidence covers the root-cause follow-up for the one-iteration smoke path.
  - task203/task206/task209 disposition: all covered by later task216+ live-validation chain; no docs-only recovery and no implementation task needed.
- PR review state:
  - #313 is docs-only, open, clean, and acceptable as the initial task-doc PR. It should land before worker closeout PRs where possible.
  - #314 is worker-owned docs/status-only coverage matrix, open and clean.
  - #315 is worker-owned docs/status-only task231 HOLD closeout, open and clean.
  - #316 is worker-owned docs/status-only task217 PM-review recovery, open and clean, but its base is `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`; after #313 lands it should be retargeted or rebased to `main` before final merge.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 3 - 2026-06-01 UTC - PR sequencing gate hold

- Read lead mailbox before coordination; no unread worker or coordinator messages were pending.
- Rechecked PR gate state after coordinator instruction not to self-merge #313:
  - #313 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, merge state `CLEAN`, no human approval/merge recorded; only Copilot review comments are present.
  - #314 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remains open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`; it still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Maintained lead gate decisions:
  - task231/task228 stays `blocked/HOLD`; #315 is pending and no new implementation task is created.
  - task217 stays approved for close as a no-launch root-cause diagnosis; #316 is pending base correction before final merge.
  - task203/task206/task209 stay `covered/no recovery`; #314 is pending after #313 approval/merge.
- Did not instruct workers to merge #314/#315/#316 because #313 has not yet received the required non-author lead approval/merge.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 4 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Continued hold after coordinator confirmation

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages before further gate monitoring.
- Rechecked PR state after coordinator confirmed the same hold condition, before committing this Session 4 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, merge state `CLEAN`, no `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remains open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- Kept the coordinator-directed hold: do not instruct workers to merge #314/#315/#316 before #313 receives non-author/authorized approval and is merged.
- Maintained the #316 final-merge requirement: retarget/rebase to `main` or follow an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- No worker task disposition changed: task231/task228 stays `blocked/HOLD`; task217 stays approved close with smoke-only residual risk; task203/task206/task209 stay `covered/no recovery`.
- Pushed the Session 4 lead bookkeeping update to the #313 branch; this changes only workspace lead status/log/knowledge files.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 5 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Hold maintained with no external gate change

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator confirmation to keep the current hold: do not instruct worker merges for #314/#315/#316 until #313 has non-author/authorized approval and is merged; #316 still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Rechecked PR state before committing this Session 5 bookkeeping update:

- No external PR base, mergeability, or worker head change was found; lead continued the hold and did not instruct worker merges.

## Session 9 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Hold maintained with bookkeeping-only reporting rule

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator acknowledgement of the Session 8 hold update and refined reporting rule: if only #313 advances because of lead bookkeeping, while #313 stays open/clean with blank `reviewDecision` and no merge, and worker PR base/mergeability/head remain unchanged, record locally without immediately escalating to coordinator.
