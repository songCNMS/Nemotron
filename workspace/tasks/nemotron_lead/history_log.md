# nemotron_lead - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=14 -->

## Session 0 - Created with team lead

- 创建 team lead `intern_nemotron_lead` 时自动生成本 manage team 常驻任务。
- 本任务在 team 存在期间保持 InProgress。

## Session 1 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Interrupted work recovery coordination

- Audited current team state: workers `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5` were Idle; coordinator and team lead anchor tasks remain Working/InProgress by lifecycle rule.
- Reported first audit to coordinator by peer send; delivery returned `delivered`.
- Mapped stale deleted assignees to current workers:
  - old `intern_nem_dev_1` task231/task228 -> `intern_nemotron_worker_1`, with independent audit by `intern_nemotron_worker_4`.
  - old `intern_nem_dev_3` task217 -> `intern_nemotron_worker_2`, with independent follow-up audit by `intern_nemotron_worker_5`.
  - old `intern_nem_dev_2` task203/task206/task209 coverage question -> `intern_nemotron_worker_3`.
- Created standard current-team task docs for task231 recovery, task217 PM-review recovery, task203/task206/task209 coverage audit, and independent audit tasks.
- Opened coordination PR #313 for the lead-created recovery task docs.
- Kept `nemotron_lead` InProgress and avoided product code changes, implementation tests, merge, and direct main push.

## Session 2 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Worker reports and lead gate decisions

- Received and processed mailbox reports from all assigned workers:
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_1` reported task231 recovery PR #315, docs/status only, with recommendation `blocked/HOLD`.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_4` independently audited task231/task228 evidence and confirmed task228 is bookkeeping only; source branch has no product-code changes and supports the same HOLD result.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_2` reported task217 PM-review recovery PR #316 with recommendation `APPROVE_CLOSE_TASK217`.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_5` independently audited task217 follow-up coverage and confirmed task218 covers the contained causal-conv unblock, while task219 closes the one-iteration train smoke loop.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_3` reported task238 coverage PR #314, classifying task203/task206/task209 as `covered/no recovery`.
- Lead gate decisions:
  - task231/task228 disposition: `blocked/HOLD`; no new implementation task now. Future implementation requires a newer approved launcher package or benchmark-owner equivalence contract for one or more missing M1 targets.
  - task217 disposition: approve close as complete no-launch diagnosis; task218/task219 evidence covers the root-cause follow-up for the one-iteration smoke path.
  - task203/task206/task209 disposition: all covered by later task216+ live-validation chain; no docs-only recovery and no implementation task needed.
- PR review state:
  - #313 is docs-only, open, clean, and acceptable as the initial task-doc PR. It should land before worker closeout PRs where possible.
  - #314 is worker-owned docs/status-only coverage matrix, open and clean.
  - #315 is worker-owned docs/status-only task231 HOLD closeout, open and clean.
  - #316 is worker-owned docs/status-only task217 PM-review recovery, open and clean, but its base is `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`; after #313 lands it should be retargeted or rebased to `main` before final merge.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 3 - 2026-06-01 UTC - PR sequencing gate hold

- Read lead mailbox before coordination; no unread worker or coordinator messages were pending.
- Rechecked PR gate state after coordinator instruction not to self-merge #313:
  - #313 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, merge state `CLEAN`, no human approval/merge recorded; only Copilot review comments are present.
  - #314 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remains open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1`, merge state `CLEAN`; it still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Maintained lead gate decisions:
  - task231/task228 stays `blocked/HOLD`; #315 is pending and no new implementation task is created.
  - task217 stays approved for close as a no-launch root-cause diagnosis; #316 is pending base correction before final merge.
  - task203/task206/task209 stay `covered/no recovery`; #314 is pending after #313 approval/merge.
- Did not instruct workers to merge #314/#315/#316 because #313 has not yet received the required non-author lead approval/merge.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 4 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Continued hold after coordinator confirmation

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages before further gate monitoring.
- Rechecked PR state after coordinator confirmed the same hold condition, before committing this Session 4 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, merge state `CLEAN`, no `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remains open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remains open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- Kept the coordinator-directed hold: do not instruct workers to merge #314/#315/#316 before #313 receives non-author/authorized approval and is merged.
- Maintained the #316 final-merge requirement: retarget/rebase to `main` or follow an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- No worker task disposition changed: task231/task228 stays `blocked/HOLD`; task217 stays approved close with smoke-only residual risk; task203/task206/task209 stay `covered/no recovery`.
- Pushed the Session 4 lead bookkeeping update to the #313 branch; this changes only workspace lead status/log/knowledge files.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 5 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Hold maintained with no external gate change

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator confirmation to keep the current hold: do not instruct worker merges for #314/#315/#316 until #313 has non-author/authorized approval and is merged; #316 still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Rechecked PR state before committing this Session 5 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `6709f3a`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.

- No external PR base, mergeability, or worker head change was found; lead continued the hold and did not instruct worker merges.
- No worker task disposition changed: task231/task228 stays `blocked/HOLD`; task217 stays approved close with smoke-only residual risk; task203/task206/task209 stay `covered/no recovery`.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator acknowledgement of the Session 5 hold update and instruction to keep holding worker PR merges until #313 has non-author/authorized approval and is merged; #316 still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Rechecked PR state before committing this Session 6 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `43e267f`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator acknowledgement of the Session 6 hold update and instruction to keep holding worker PR merges until #313 has non-author/authorized approval and is merged; #316 still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- Rechecked PR state before committing this Session 7 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `8b6664a`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.

## Session 9 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Hold maintained with bookkeeping-only reporting rule

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Received coordinator acknowledgement of the Session 8 hold update and refined reporting rule: if only #313 advances because of lead bookkeeping, while #313 stays open/clean with blank `reviewDecision` and no merge, and worker PR base/mergeability/head remain unchanged, record locally without immediately escalating to coordinator.
- Rechecked PR state before committing this Session 9 bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `44e4a7f`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.

- Rechecked PR state:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `cf7cb71`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remained open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- This was a no-transition gate check: no worker merge instruction and no coordinator escalation were sent.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

### Gate Check - 2026-06-01 UTC - Hold remains stable

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Rechecked PR state:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `38754f1`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remained open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- This was a no-transition gate check: no worker merge instruction and no coordinator escalation were sent.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

### Gate Check - 2026-06-01 UTC - External approval gate persists

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Rechecked PR state:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `c4cfe0e`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remained open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- The same external #313 approval/merge gate has persisted across repeated goal turns; lead cannot proceed to worker-owned #314/#315 sequencing or #316 retarget/rebase without that external state change.
- Workspace task status remains Working/InProgress because `nemotron_lead` is a permanent team lead lifecycle task; no worker merge instruction and no coordinator escalation were sent.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 10 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Merge request routed through approval gate

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages before handling the user's "merge the pr" request.
- Interpreted the request as applying to the active lead gate PR #313, with downstream worker PRs still sequenced behind it.
- Rechecked PR state before this bookkeeping update:
  - #313 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `2de74ad`, merge state `CLEAN`, blank `reviewDecision`, and no merge recorded.
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #315 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `CLEAN`.
  - #316 remained open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`.
- Lead did not merge #313 directly because the active team-lead boundary still prohibits self-merge/main push; the merge request must be routed to a non-author/authorized approver or coordinator-owned merge path.
- Continued holding worker PR sequencing: do not direct #314/#315/#316 final merge until #313 lands; #316 still requires retarget/rebase to `main` or an explicit post-#313 path before final merge.
- No product code was changed by lead; no implementation tests, evals, launches, or merges were run by lead.

## Session 11 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Post-#313 worker PR refresh coordination

- Received coordinator confirmation that #313 was merged by `songCNMS` at 2026-06-01T14:46:49Z with merge commit `a35f61f38ed46f752ad3037d71b69ff19530cce6` and merged head `bbb61b1`.
- Rechecked downstream PR state after #313 landed:
  - #314 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_3/task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` at `5987d1d`, merge state `DIRTY`.
  - #315 remained open, base `main`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` at `63201eb`, merge state `DIRTY`.
  - #316 remained open, base `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`, head `intern_nemotron_worker_2/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` at `c3a1c91`, merge state `CLEAN`, but still stacked on the former #313 branch.
- Read lead mailbox before worker coordination; no unread messages were pending.
- Directed `intern_nemotron_worker_3` to update #314 against current `main`, resolve docs/status closeout conflicts only, push, and report new head SHA, mergeability, touched files, and whether task203/task206/task209 remain `covered/no recovery`.
- Directed `intern_nemotron_worker_1` to update #315 against current `main`, resolve docs/status closeout conflicts only, push, and report new head SHA, mergeability, touched files, and whether task231/task228 remain `blocked/HOLD` with no new implementation task.
- Directed `intern_nemotron_worker_2` to retarget/rebase #316 to `main` or provide a clear post-#313 path, then report new base, head SHA, mergeability, touched files, and whether task217 remains approved close with the one-iteration smoke residual risk.
- Current lead gate dispositions remain unchanged pending worker refresh reports: task231/task228 `blocked/HOLD`; task217 approve close with smoke-only residual risk; task203/task206/task209 `covered/no recovery`.
- Lead did not implement, run tests, merge, or push `main`.

## Session 12 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Downstream PR approval for worker self-merge

- Read lead mailbox and processed worker refresh reports:
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_3` reported #314 refreshed to head `725096ca3544b202c33dae9c24caf04ba404c007`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`, docs/status-only conflict resolution, and unchanged task203/task206/task209 disposition: `covered/no recovery`.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_1` reported #315 refreshed to head `49e2f1a381542aac16425e2b6fe9f38fa4332709`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`, docs/status-only conflict resolution, and unchanged task231/task228 disposition: `blocked/HOLD` with no new implementation task.
  - `intern_nemotron_worker_2` reported #316 retargeted/rebased to base `main` at head `8a78d9e7a14a584dfa6dcbfac291016da52c9834`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`, docs/status-only refresh, and unchanged task217 disposition: approve close with one-iteration smoke residual risk.
- Independently rechecked GitHub PR states:
  - #314 open, base `main`, head `725096c`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`.
  - #315 open, base `main`, head `49e2f1a`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`.
  - #316 open, base `main`, head `8a78d9e`, mergeStateStatus `CLEAN`.
- Independently reviewed PR file lists and confirmed all three diffs are limited to worker status and task workspace docs; no product/source files are included.
- Lead gate decisions: approve #314, approve #315, and approve #316 for worker self-merge, each conditional on GitHub still showing mergeable at merge time.
- Sent self-merge instructions to `intern_nemotron_worker_3`, `intern_nemotron_worker_1`, and `intern_nemotron_worker_2`; each worker was told to merge only if mergeability remains valid and to report mergedAt, merge commit, and any post-merge issue.
- Short follow-up poll after notifications found no unread worker merge reports yet; #314/#315/#316 remained open and `CLEAN`.
- Later Session 12 polling found downstream merge completion:
  - #315 merged at 2026-06-01T14:59:37Z, head `49e2f1a381542aac16425e2b6fe9f38fa4332709`, merge commit `80696c65d433d297eadd28b673a41f4451bd16d6`, merged by `songCNMS`; `intern_nemotron_worker_1` mailbox confirmed no post-merge issue and unchanged `blocked/HOLD` disposition.
  - #316 merged at 2026-06-01T14:59:44Z, head `8a78d9e7a14a584dfa6dcbfac291016da52c9834`, merge commit `3d4d3162ea25555208938f6d5635ca24b91b6d20`, merged by `songCNMS`; `intern_nemotron_worker_2` mailbox confirmed no post-merge issue and unchanged approve-close disposition with one-iteration smoke residual risk.
  - #314 advanced after approval from `725096c` to `3520b37e855d58ed118c7d6d280561cca1803a44`; lead requested a new worker report for that head, then observed #314 merged at 2026-06-01T15:01:14Z with merge commit `f5a844765c5ac1a756b7f7e94d27ee466fe25a9b`, merged by `songCNMS`.
- `intern_nemotron_worker_3` later sent the #314 final-head merge report: the `3520b37` change was docs/status closeout only, files remained under workspace intern/task docs, no product/source code was changed, and task203/task206/task209 remain `covered/no recovery`.
- Final observed PR state for this turn: #314/#315/#316 all `MERGED`, and worker closeout reports have been received for all three downstream PRs.
- Lead did not implement, run tests, merge, or push `main`.

## Session 13 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Coordinator-confirmed recovery closeout archived

- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Rechecked GitHub state for downstream recovery PRs:
  - #314 remained `MERGED`, head `3520b37e855d58ed118c7d6d280561cca1803a44`, merged at 2026-06-01T15:01:14Z with merge commit `f5a844765c5ac1a756b7f7e94d27ee466fe25a9b`.
  - #315 remained `MERGED`, head `49e2f1a381542aac16425e2b6fe9f38fa4332709`, merged at 2026-06-01T14:59:37Z with merge commit `80696c65d433d297eadd28b673a41f4451bd16d6`.
  - #316 remained `MERGED`, head `8a78d9e7a14a584dfa6dcbfac291016da52c9834`, merged at 2026-06-01T14:59:44Z with merge commit `3d4d3162ea25555208938f6d5635ca24b91b6d20`.
- Received coordinator confirmation that the recovery task closeout is complete and matches lead-reported dispositions:
  - task203/task206/task209: `covered/no recovery`.
  - task231/task228: `blocked/HOLD`, no new implementation task.
  - task217: approve close with one-iteration smoke residual risk retained.
- Updated lead status to reflect recovery closeout completion while keeping `nemotron_lead` Working/InProgress as a permanent team lead lifecycle task.
- No residual cleanup requiring product/source edits, implementation tests, or lead-side merge was identified.
- Lead did not implement, run tests, merge, or push `main`.

## Session 14 - 2026-06-01 UTC - Monitoring state confirmed

- Received coordinator acknowledgement that lead branch `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` at `04582ca` matches the archive update and that recovery closeout is complete on the lead side.
- Read lead mailbox and found no unread messages.
- Confirmed no residual cleanup currently requires lead action.
- Kept `nemotron_lead` in Working/InProgress monitoring state as the permanent team lead lifecycle task.
- No worker assignment was needed because there is no active residual cleanup, new user request, abnormal regression, or testable implementation change.
- Lead did not implement, run tests, merge, or push `main`.
