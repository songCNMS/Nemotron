# task_coordinator_nemotron_coordinator_06b9acba - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=2 -->

## Session 0 - Created with coordinator

- 创建 coordinator `intern_nemotron_coordinator` 时自动生成本永续任务。
- 本任务在 coordinator 存在期间保持 InProgress。

## Session 1 - Resume interrupted coordination

- Rechecked coordinator anchor task, coordinator metadata, team metadata, lead status, worker status, and current git branch state after the interruption.
- Confirmed the coordinator task and `nemotron_lead` management task remain InProgress by lifecycle rule; `intern_nemotron_lead` is active, and current `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5` were Idle at audit time.
- Found many historical workspace tasks still marked InProgress/Working, mostly assigned to legacy intern names rather than the current team worker names; treated this as lead-level triage material rather than direct coordinator implementation work.
- Set pressing goal `coord-resume-interrupted-work-session-1` for `intern_nemotron_lead` via `/api/intern/goal/set`; API returned `delivered` with HTTP 200. The goal directs the lead to audit interrupted ordinary tasks, prioritize Working tasks, map recoverable work to current workers using standard task docs, and report back to the coordinator.

## Session 2 - Lead recovery audit received

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` first audit report: team workers are active and Idle; lead/coordinator remain Working; coordinator anchor and `nemotron_lead` management tasks remain InProgress by lifecycle rule.
- Lead found current GitHub open PR list only contains coordinator PR #312; many old workspace task statuses appear stale because historical PRs were merged and legacy assignees were removed from main.
- Lead identified priority recovery candidates from unmerged old branches: `origin/intern_nem_dev_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` with task231/task228 still Working, and `origin/intern_nem_dev_3/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` as ReadyForPMReview. task203/task206/task209 require more evidence because later task216+ live evidence may supersede them.
- Sent delivered peer instruction to `intern_nemotron_lead` confirming the recovery priority order and requiring standard task docs, assignment to current `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5`, and next report with task_id, worker, source branch/old task, expected artifact, verification arrangement, and PR reuse/new PR decision.
