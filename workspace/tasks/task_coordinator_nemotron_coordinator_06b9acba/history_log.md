# task_coordinator_nemotron_coordinator_06b9acba - History Log

<!-- METADATA:SESSION=13 -->

## Session 0 - Created with coordinator

- 创建 coordinator `intern_nemotron_coordinator` 时自动生成本永续任务。
- 本任务在 coordinator 存在期间保持 InProgress。

## Session 1 - Resume interrupted coordination

- Rechecked coordinator anchor task, coordinator metadata, team metadata, lead status, worker status, and current git branch state after the interruption.
- Confirmed the coordinator task and `nemotron_lead` management task remain InProgress by lifecycle rule; `intern_nemotron_lead` is active, and current `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5` were Idle at audit time.
- Found many historical workspace tasks still marked InProgress/Working, mostly assigned to legacy intern names rather than the current team worker names; treated this as lead-level triage material rather than direct coordinator implementation work.
- Set pressing goal `coord-resume-interrupted-work-session-1` for `intern_nemotron_lead` via `/api/intern/goal/set`; API returned `delivered` with HTTP 200. The goal directs the lead to audit interrupted ordinary tasks, prioritize Working tasks, map recoverable work to current workers using standard task docs, and report back to the coordinator.

## Session 2 - Lead recovery audit received

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` first audit report: team workers are active and Idle; lead/coordinator remain Working; coordinator anchor and `nemotron_lead` management tasks remain InProgress by lifecycle rule.
- Lead found current GitHub open PR list only contains coordinator PR #312; many old workspace task statuses appear stale because historical PRs were merged and legacy assignees were removed from main.
- Lead identified priority recovery candidates from unmerged old branches: `origin/intern_nem_dev_1/task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` with task231/task228 still Working, and `origin/intern_nem_dev_3/task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` as ReadyForPMReview. task203/task206/task209 require more evidence because later task216+ live evidence may supersede them.
- Sent delivered peer instruction to `intern_nemotron_lead` confirming the recovery priority order and requiring standard task docs, assignment to current `intern_nemotron_worker_1` through `intern_nemotron_worker_5`, and next report with task_id, worker, source branch/old task, expected artifact, verification arrangement, and PR reuse/new PR decision.

## Session 3 - Recovery tasks assigned

- Received lead report that recovery work was converted into current-team executable task docs and assigned to all five workers. Lead coordination PR #313 (`intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`) is open.
- Recorded primary assignments: `task231_m1_missing_launcher_new_runtime_scan_s1` to `intern_nemotron_worker_1`, `task217_mamba_causal_conv_train_stack_unblock_probe_s1` to `intern_nemotron_worker_2`, and `task238_task203_206_209_coverage_audit_s1` to `intern_nemotron_worker_3`.
- Recorded independent verification assignments: `task239_task231_independent_evidence_audit_s1` to `intern_nemotron_worker_4` for task231 evidence, and `task240_task217_independent_followup_audit_s1` to `intern_nemotron_worker_5` for task217 follow-up coverage.
- Verified PR #313 is open and contains the lead status/knowledge updates plus task docs for task217, task231, task238, task239, and task240.
- Sent delivered peer acknowledgement to `intern_nemotron_lead`, asking the lead to wait for mailbox reports and return gate decisions: task231 disposition, task217 approve/request-changes/block, task203/206/209 coverage matrix outcome, PR #313 merge readiness, and whether new worker-owned PRs or implementation tasks are needed.

## Session 4 - Printed project rules

- Read and printed `workspace/project_rule.txt` for the user.
- Confirmed the file currently contains only the Nemotron project rules heading and applicability note.
- No coordinator goal change, team task routing, implementation, test, or merge action was performed in this session.

## Session 5 - Recovery gate report received

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` gate report after mailbox processing reached unread=0; lead Session 2 gate records were committed to PR #313 head `9f3b5cf`.
- Recorded gate outcomes: task231/task228 close as blocked/HOLD with no new implementation task until an approved launcher package or benchmark-owner equivalence contract exists; task217 approve close with residual risk limited to not-full-training/eval; task203/task206/task209 covered/no recovery.
- Verified PR state: #313 open for lead task docs/gate records; #314 and #315 open against main and mergeable; #316 open against `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs` and must be retargeted/rebased to main or otherwise adjusted after #313 lands.
- Sent delivered peer acknowledgement to `intern_nemotron_lead`, confirming gate conclusions and instructing the lead to avoid self-merging #313, wait for non-author/authorized approval or merge, then sequence #314/#315/#316 worker closeout PRs.

## Session 6 - Gate hold state confirmed

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` Session 3 gate update: mailbox unread remained 0, no implementation, test, launch, or merge action was performed, and #313 had been updated to head `43293a6`.
- Verified current PR state: #313 open/mergeable against main with blank reviewDecision; #314 open/mergeable against main at `5987d1d`; #315 open/mergeable against main at `63201eb`; #316 open/mergeable at `c3a1c91` with base still `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`.
- Confirmed dispositions remain unchanged: task231/task228 blocked/HOLD, task217 approve close with smoke-only residual risk, and task203/task206/task209 covered/no recovery.
- Sent delivered peer acknowledgement to `intern_nemotron_lead`, instructing the lead to keep holding #314/#315/#316 until #313 receives non-author/authorized approval and merges, and to report immediately if #313 approval/merge state or any worker PR base/mergeability changes.

## Session 7 - Hold acknowledgement received

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` Session 4 hold acknowledgement: mailbox had no unread messages, lead kept the hold, did not instruct workers to merge, and did not implement, merge, or run implementation tests.

- Sent delivered peer acknowledgement to `intern_nemotron_lead`, confirming continued hold and clarifying that pure #313 lead-bookkeeping head-only changes with no review/merge/base/mergeability change do not need immediate coordinator escalation.

## Session 12 - Merged lead recovery PR

- Interpreted the user request "merge the pr" as the active lead recovery docs/gate PR #313, because coordinator PR #312 is this permanent coordinator record branch and the coordinator anchor task must remain InProgress.
- Confirmed #313 was open and mergeable at head `bbb61b1`; attempted `codeup_pr merge 313`, but it failed with a 403 token permission error.
- Merged #313 using GitHub CLI squash merge. GitHub reports #313 state `MERGED`, mergedAt `2026-06-01T14:46:49Z`, merge commit `a35f61f38ed46f752ad3037d71b69ff19530cce6`.
- Rechecked downstream worker PRs after #313 landed: #314 and #315 are open against main but now conflicting/dirty; #316 remains open and mergeable but is still based on `intern_nemotron_lead/session1-recovery-task-docs`.
- Sent delivered peer notification to `intern_nemotron_lead` directing lead-side coordination only: worker_3/worker_1 should refresh #314/#315 against main and report new heads/mergeability, while worker_2 should retarget/rebase #316 to main or provide an explicit post-#313 merge path.
- Received lead immediate gate update confirming #313 merged, #314/#315 are dirty, #316 remains stacked, and lead is asking the relevant workers to perform docs-only refresh/retarget work without self-merging.

## Session 13 - Post-merge downstream tracking

- Received `intern_nemotron_lead` Session 11 status: #313 is merged at `2026-06-01T14:46:49Z`, lead notified worker_3 for #314 refresh, worker_1 for #315 refresh, and worker_2 for #316 retarget/rebase; lead did not implement, test, or merge.
- Verified #313 remains `MERGED` with merge commit `a35f61f38ed46f752ad3037d71b69ff19530cce6`.
- Initial downstream recheck showed #314 had advanced to head `725096c` with mergeability `UNKNOWN`, #315 remained conflicting, and #316 remained stacked; a later recheck showed all three worker PRs refreshed to main and mergeable: #314 at `725096c`, #315 at `49e2f1a`, and #316 at `8a78d9e`.
- Sent delivered peer acknowledgement to `intern_nemotron_lead`, first asking lead to continue waiting for worker mailbox reports, then updating lead that #314/#315/#316 are refreshed and mergeable and should move through lead gate decision before any worker self-merge.
