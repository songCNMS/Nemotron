# Nemotron 3 Nano Omni — Architecture

A deep-dive into the architectural decisions behind Nemotron 3 Nano Omni — what's in the model, why each piece is there, and where the efficiency story comes from. For training instructions see the [recipe overview](./README.md); for deployment see [`inference.md`](./inference.md).

![Nemotron 3 Nano Omni hybrid MoE architecture: Parakeet audio encoder → audio adaptor, C-RADIOv4-H vision encoder + 3D convolution + Efficient Video Sampling → vision adaptor, text tokenizer, all feeding the unified 30B-A3B LLM decoder](../../assets/omni-3.png)

*Figure 1. Cross-modal integration. Each modality has a dedicated encoder and adaptor; all token streams converge on the unified 30B-A3B Mamba-transformer decoder, which is the only place reasoning happens.*

## Hybrid MoE decoder

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Total parameters | 30B |
| Active parameters per forward pass | 3B |
| Architecture | Hybrid MoE |
| Layer mix | Mamba layers (sequence/memory efficiency) + transformer layers (reasoning) |
| Decoder | Unified text decoder serves as the central reasoning core for all modalities |
| Max context length | 262K tokens |
| Training context schedule | 16K → 49K → 262K (progressive scaling, see [§Progressive context scaling](#progressive-context-scaling)) |

The "A3B" in the model name (`30B-A3B`) means **30B total parameters / 3B active**: the MoE router selects a small subset of expert layers per token, so inference compute is bounded by the 3B active count rather than the 30B total. The Mamba layers handle long-context state with linear time/memory; the transformer layers handle the local-reasoning hot path. The two compose into a unified decoder that all modality encoders feed into — so reasoning, planning, and tool-calling stay in one place rather than fanning out to per-modality heads.

## Vision encoder — C-RADIOv4-H

The vision side uses **C-RADIOv4-H**, a high-resolution image encoder. It's the same family as RADIO (Robust Anti-Distillation On vision foundation models) — a learned distillation across multiple frozen teacher models (CLIP, DINOv2, SAM, etc.) that produces a single ViT capable of standing in for any of them. The "v4-H" variant is the high-res release with stronger document-understanding signal, which is part of why omni places best-in-class on **MMlongbench-Doc** and **OCRBenchV2**.

## Audio encoder — Parakeet (extended)

Audio uses **NVIDIA Parakeet** as the encoder, extended via the **Granary** and **Music Flamingo** integrations. Parakeet alone gives strong ASR; the Granary/Music Flamingo extensions broaden the audio surface (paralinguistic, music, ambient sound) which is what makes the model competitive on **VoiceBench** and gives it a usable audio interface for general media-understanding tasks rather than just transcription.

## Video pipeline — 3D convolutions + Efficient Video Sampling (EVS)

Video is handled in two stages: **3D convolutions** capture spatiotemporal features natively (motion is a first-class signal, not inferred from a frame-by-frame transcript), and an **Efficient Video Sampling (EVS) layer** compresses high-density visual tokens across consecutive frames before they hit the decoder.

This is the key efficiency lever for the model. The release blog cites:
- **~9.2× greater effective system capacity** vs. comparable open omni models on video reasoning workloads
- **~7.4× greater capacity** on multi-document workloads
- **"Highest throughput across every task"** in the MediaPerf benchmark, **"lowest inference cost for video-level tagging"**

Why 3D conv + EVS is decisive vs. transcript-style approaches:

- **3D conv preserves motion**. Frame-by-frame transcript pipelines can't see motion natively — they hallucinate temporal relations from spatial features in adjacent frames. Native 3D conv gives the decoder real motion features.
- **EVS bounds the token count**. Without EVS, a 60-second video at 24 fps × per-frame patch count blows past 262K tokens trivially. EVS compresses frame redundancy *before* the decoder, so the unified text decoder can still reason over the full clip in-context.

If you're doing video-heavy inference and tuning for throughput, EVS configuration is the lever to optimize — see [`inference.md`](./inference.md) for runtime knobs.

## Progressive context scaling

The **16K → 49K → 262K** sequence is a *training schedule*, not a property of the inference model. The training pipeline grows the context window in stages so the model first masters short-context cross-modal instruction-following, then extends to medium context, and finally to long context — each stage unfreezing more parameters as needed. This is the same recipe shape used by Nemotron 3 Nano's pretrain → SFT → RL flow, scaled to the multimodal case.

## Synthetic data — long-document SDG

The release blog calls out **~11.4M synthetic visual QA pairs (~45B tokens)** generated via NVIDIA NeMo Data Designer. The long-document SDG recipe is published in this repository ([guide](../data/sdg/long-document.md), [source](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/tree/89a6da531c4c693da585a7cc9ac96c51492bffa4/src/nemotron/recipes/data/sdg/long-document)) — a 9-stage pipeline with structured argparse surfaces. The design discussion lives in [`designs/long-document-sdg-pipeline.md`](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/blob/89a6da531c4c693da585a7cc9ac96c51492bffa4/designs/long-document-sdg-pipeline.md).

## Training scale (release figures)

| Stage | Scale |
|---|---|
| Adapter & encoder training | ~127B tokens, mixed modalities (text+image, text+video, text+audio, text+video+audio) |
| Curated post-training examples | ~124M |
| RL alignment | 20 datasets across 25 environments, ~2.3M rollouts |
| Synthetic visual QA | ~11.4M pairs / ~45B tokens |

This recipe folder reproduces the **public-data subset** of these stages — see each stage doc for which datasets are open-source vs. internal-only.

## Why "perception sub-agent"

The release blog frames omni as a **multimodal perception sub-agent for agentic AI** — *not* a general-purpose chat model. The architecture choices follow:

- **Single unified decoder** so an outer agent can call this model with any combination of modalities and get reasoning back through one stable interface
- **EVS-bounded video tokens** so the model can be invoked on full-length video inputs without per-clip pre-processing pipelines
- **Reasoning-trained checkpoint** (`Reasoning-BF16` suffix) for explicit multi-step thinking before tool calls
- **NIM + open-license** so it can drop into existing agent stacks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom orchestrators) without licensing friction

Stage docs ([`sft.md`](./sft.md), [`rl.md`](./rl.md)) train and align this perception-sub-agent surface — instruction-following over multimodal inputs, not free-form chat.

## License
