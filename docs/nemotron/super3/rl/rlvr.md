# Multi-Environment RLVR (Stages 1.1–1.3)

Multi-environment Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is the primary RL stage for Nemotron 3 Super. It trains on 21 environments and 37 datasets simultaneously, covering math, code, STEM, safety, chat, instruction following, long context, puzzles, and agentic tasks.

Training on all environments simultaneously yields stable gains — single-environment training leads to severe regressions on other benchmarks.

The RLVR stage consists of 3 sub-stages with different data blends. All 3 use the same config (`stage1_rlvr.yaml`), only the data paths differ.

## Data

| Domain | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Math** | Competitive math problems, trained with and without python execution tool. Includes formal proof verification environment. |
| **Code** | Competition code data. |
| **STEM** | Scientific problems including newly curated difficult problems. |
| **Instruction Following** | Standard IF data plus a multi-challenge style dataset where the agent follows complex instructions scored against a rubric. |
| **Safety** | Two environments: (1) mitigating overrefusals on safety-related prompts, (2) robustness against jailbreak attacks using PAIR-generated adversarial prompts. |
| **Long Context** | Long context reasoning environment. |
| **Agentic Tool Use** | Conversational tool use and terminal use environments. |
| **Reasoning Gym** | Diverse reasoning tasks from [Reasoning Gym](https://github.com/reasoning-gym/reasoning-gym). |

**Data Curriculum:** Prompts where the SFT model consistently provides correct answers are filtered out. Remaining samples are sorted via a difficulty-based curriculum.

### Low-Effort Reasoning

A subset of prompts are converted to low-effort mode. For each low-effort prompt, the reward accounts for both correctness and token count, encouraging efficient reasoning.

| Phase | Scope | Proportion |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Early | Math, STEM QA, Competitive Coding | 2% of all RL prompts |
| Late | Math, STEM QA only | 1% of RL prompts |

## Algorithm

Uses **asynchronous GRPO** where training and inference are decoupled across separate GPU devices:

- Inference workers continuously generate trajectories stored in a rollout buffer
- Batches are sent to the training engine once enough trajectories are collected
- Updated weights are pushed to inference workers as soon as a new model version is available
- **In-flight weight updates**: weights can be pushed mid-rollout without waiting for ongoing rollouts to finish
- KV cache is NOT recomputed after weight updates
- Policy lag is limited to at most one step behind the latest model version
- Importance sampling ratio masking stabilizes training under the training-inference mismatch

## Infrastructure

All RLVR experiments use an integrated NeMo RL + NeMo Gym infrastructure:

- **NeMo RL** acts as the RL training loop controller using Megatron-Core for model training
- **NeMo Gym** handles rollout environments using three server types: agents, models (vLLM), and resources (verifiers)
- **Ray** orchestrates resource management on SLURM — training workers, vLLM generation workers, Gym environments, and judge models all run on a single Ray cluster

### Judge Models

| Model | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Qwen3-235B-A22B | Equivalence/instruction-following judging |
| Nemotron-Content-Safety-Reasoning-4B | Safety evaluation |
| Qwen3-Nemotron-235B-A22B-GenRM | GenRM pairwise comparison |

### Resiliency at 1K GPU Scale

At 1K GPU scale, intermittent failures from hardware and software issues required:

- Parallelized initialization with prefetching of virtual environments and binaries
- Careful port management to avoid TOCTOU race conditions between Ray control plane, vLLM workers, TCP rendezvous, and NeMo Gym servers
- Caching in upstream repos (vLLM, flashinfer) to reduce startup time

## Usage

### Using nemotron CLI

```bash
# Stage 1.1–1.3: RLVR (uses base container)
uv run nemotron super3 rl rlvr -c rlvr1 --run YOUR-CLUSTER
uv run nemotron super3 rl rlvr -c rlvr2 --run YOUR-CLUSTER
uv run nemotron super3 rl rlvr -c rlvr3 --run YOUR-CLUSTER
```

> **`--run YOUR-CLUSTER`** refers to a profile defined in your `env.toml` file.
> See the [env.toml setup guide](../README.md#configuration) for details.
