# Stage 3: Quantization

This stage applies post-training quantization (PTQ) to the aligned Nemotron 3 Super model for efficient deployment across GPU generations.

---

## Overview

Quantization improves inference efficiency in several ways: quantized GEMMs increase compute throughput, quantized weights reduce model memory footprint, and quantized caches accelerate memory-bound workloads such as decoding.

Two quantized checkpoints are released:

| Checkpoint | Target Hardware | Format | Key Benefit |
|------------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| **FP8** (W8A8) | Hopper (H100) | FP8 weights and activations | Balanced accuracy/throughput |
| **NVFP4** (W4A4) | Blackwell (B200) | NVFP4 weights and activations | 1.5--2.2x higher GEMM FLOPS than FP8 |

Both checkpoints are produced using [Model Optimizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq) PTQ with [Megatron-Bridge](../nvidia-stack.md#megatron-bridge).

## FP8 Checkpoint

The FP8 checkpoint quantizes MoE GEMMs and Mamba GEMMs to FP8, with FP8 KV Cache quantization. The Mamba state cache is quantized to FP16 (from FP32) for speedup. Calibration used 256 samples from the post-training SFT dataset.

### Precision Settings

| Configuration | FP8 Checkpoint | BF16 Baseline |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Embedding | BF16 | BF16 |
| Attention GEMM (QKV and Out Projection) | BF16 | BF16 |
| KV Cache + Attention BMM1 | FP8 | FP8 |
| Attention BMM2 | BF16 | BF16 |
| MoE GEMM (Sparse Experts and Shared Experts) | FP8 | BF16 |
| MoE Latent Projection GEMM | BF16 | BF16 |
| Router | FP32 | FP32 |
| Mamba GEMM | FP8 | BF16 |
| Mamba SSM Kernel | FP16 | FP32 |
| Mamba 1D Conv | BF16 | BF16 |
| Output Layers | BF16 | BF16 |

---

## NVFP4 Checkpoint

FP4 is attractive for efficient inference because NVFP4 offers roughly 1.5x--2.2x higher GEMM FLOPS than FP8 on Blackwell GPUs, while also reducing model memory footprint by about 2x. This makes FP4 especially appealing for prefill-heavy workloads, such as coding-agent deployments, where MoE GEMMs dominate latency.

### FP4 PTQ Recipe

The best results were obtained with a **hybrid FP4 recipe**:

| Component | Scaling Method | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Weight per-block scales** | Minimizing weight MSE | Calibrated offline; supports scale search |
| **Activation per-block scales** | Max-based scaling | Must be computed efficiently at runtime |

Despite these improvements, the PTQ recipe still left a median accuracy gap of more than 1% relative to BF16. To recover this loss, **AutoQuantize** is used to automatically assign each layer to FP4, FP8, or BF16 based on both sensitivity and performance cost.

AutoQuantize is a mixed-precision quantization algorithm that casts format assignment as a neural architecture search (NAS) problem under a deployment-cost budget. It estimates operator sensitivity using a second-order Taylor approximation (inspired by Optimal Brain Surgeon), models performance cost, and solves for the allocation that minimizes total sensitivity subject to the cost constraint.

**Result:** The mixed-precision PTQ process completes in less than 2 hours on a single B200 node (8 GPUs) using 512 samples. The resulting model achieves **99.8% median accuracy** relative to BF16 while retaining near-FP4 performance.

### FP4 QAD (Quantization-Aware Distillation)

QAD uses the BF16 checkpoint as teacher and the NVFP4 checkpoint as student:

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Calibration (PTQ student)** | 2K samples, 131K context from post-training reasoning SFT |
| **Loss Function** | Logit-based loss (best of logit, logit+LM, hidden-cosine) |
| **Learning Rate** | 1e-5 |
| **Data Blend** | SFT + RL on-policy rollouts (60:40 ratio) |
| **Training Budget** | 5B tokens |

### Mamba State Quantization

The Mamba SSM cache presents a unique quantization challenge: during training the cache is computed via chunked SSD without per-token quantization boundaries, but during inference per-token recurrent quantization accumulates errors across every token.

**Selected Recipe:** FP16 with Stochastic Rounding (Philox<5>)

| Reason | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| No block scales required | Simpler implementation |
| Blackwell hardware support | Dedicated PTX instruction for FP16 conversion with stochastic rounding |
| cuRAND support | Philox PRNG on Blackwell via cuRAND |
| Accuracy | Maintains accuracy and verbosity with Philox round count of 5 |

## Quantization Configurations

Nemotron 3 Super supports four quantization configurations tailored for the Mamba-MoE architecture:

| Config Name | Format | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `mamba_moe_fp8_aggressive` | FP8 | Aggressive FP8 quantization for Mamba-MoE |
| `mamba_moe_fp8_conservative` | FP8 | Conservative FP8 quantization for Mamba-MoE |
| `mamba_moe_nvfp4_aggressive` | NVFP4 | Aggressive NVFP4 quantization for Mamba-MoE |
| `mamba_moe_nvfp4_conservative` | NVFP4 | Conservative NVFP4 quantization for Mamba-MoE |

Pass the desired config name via `--export-quant-cfg` to `quantize.py`.

## Recipe Execution

### Direct Script Execution (Megatron-Bridge)

For direct execution, use the scripts in the [Megatron-Bridge](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge) repository:

```bash
# Clone the repository and checkout the pinned super-v3 revision
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Megatron-Bridge.git
cd Megatron-Bridge
git checkout f570c0529c81b57cb2ae909bd31a19408c7f4583  # super-v3
```

### Quantize

```bash
export HF_MODEL=/path/to/hf/model
export MEGATRON_SAVE_PATH=/path/to/quantized/megatron/ckpt

torchrun --nproc_per_node=16 examples/quantization/quantize.py \
    --hf-model-id $HF_MODEL \

### Export Quantized Megatron Checkpoint to HuggingFace

After quantization, export the Megatron checkpoint back to HuggingFace format:

```bash
export EXPORT_DIR=/path/to/output/hf/ckpt

torchrun --nproc_per_node=16 examples/quantization/export.py \
    --hf-model-id $HF_MODEL \
    --megatron-load-path $MEGATRON_SAVE_PATH \
    --export-dir $EXPORT_DIR \
    --pp 8 \
    --dtype bfloat16 \
    --trust-remote-code
```

> **Note**: For multi-node setups (e.g., 2 nodes with 8× H100), increase `--pp` accordingly and use a job scheduler like SLURM to launch across nodes.

## Quantized Model Evaluation

Comparison of BF16, FP8, and NVFP4 checkpoints.

> **Note**: LiveCodeBench uses v6 here (vs v5 in the [post-trained model evaluations](./evaluate.md)), which accounts for the slightly different BF16 baselines between the two tables.
